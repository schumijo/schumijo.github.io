Updating this theme is a straightforwarded process and we tried to make it as easy as possible. You should already know the steps from installing the “theme”:

Download this repository as a zip file to your computer. You can do so by clicking the green button in the top right with the lable “Code” and choosing “Download ZIP”.
Unpack the zip-file to a location of your choice on your computer.
Copy the content (files and folders) of the folder config from this repository into your HomeAssistant config folder, overwriting the files with the downloaded (new) version.
If you’re using language specific settings, remember to also copy the language file! See here for more details on language specific settings.
If you use custom-cards and followed the instructions to install them, everything is fine, they will not be overwritten or otherwise changed.
To check, which version you have installed, you can always find the version number(s) in the seperate file changelog.
